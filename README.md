# Inspect in CS2
Userscript for web browser to easily generate console commands to inspect items in Counter-Strike 2! âœ¨

Adds native-looking buttons in the usual places on Steam Inventory items and Community Market listings that copy a 'csgo_econ_action_preview' console command to your clipboard that you can paste into the console in-game to inspect skins.


## How to Install
1. Install 
   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) /   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) /   [FireMonkey (Firefox only)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/)    or other userscript extension of your choice to your web browser.
2. Follow [this link](https://github.com/pirssi/cs2-inspect/raw/main/cs2inspect.user.js) and your extension should automatically prompt you to install the script.
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

**OR**

1. If the extension didn't automatically prompt you to install the script, select 'New' or 'Create a new script' in the extension's toolbar icon or settings  
2. Copy the URL https://github.com/pirssi/cs2-inspect/raw/main/cs2inspect.user.js and paste it into the 'Install from URL'/'Input URL' field in the extension  
 **OR**  
Go to [this link](https://github.com/pirssi/cs2-inspect/raw/main/cs2inspect.user.js) for the script and paste it manually into the 'New script' window (replacing the template code there).
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

## General notes
The script was quickly scrambled together, and although I didn't seem to find any bigger problems, there may be some bugs or the occasional error in the browser console, so feel free to hit me up through the GitHub issues page or any of the links found on my [home page](https://pirss.in/) if you come across any. :)
Your extension should also automatically check for updates to the script (unless you have it disabled), in case any updates are pushed to the script on this repo page.   
 
P.S.,
You can choose to either show both 'Inspect in Game...' for CS:GO and 'Inspect in CS2...' for CS2 (default), or only show the 'Inspect in CS2...' buttons by changing the variable at the beginning of the script (further explained in the script).
